**DF-SHOW (Directory File Show) is a Unix-like rewrite of some of the applications from Larry Kroeker's DF-EDIT (Directory File Editor) for MS-DOS and PC-DOS systems, based on the Version 2.3d release from 1986.**

* `Bug Tracker`_

.. _`Bug Tracker`: https://github.com/roberthawdon/dfshow/issues

Introduction
------------

The show application lets users view the names of files and directories on a disk with information about the files. Files can be copied, moved, viewed, and edited (in your system's default editor). The application is run using the ``show`` command. The output is similar to the ``ls`` command. A file view is also included which can be invoked using the ``sf`` command.

Features
--------

* **List files.** DF-SHOW's primary function is to display a list of files on a system, in an interactive display allowing users' to browse up and down large lists of files in a directory.
* **View files.** The ability to quickly peek into text files makes DF-SHOW a powerful tool for power users, this function uses the default pager defined in the user's system environment or the included ``sf`` application.
* **Edit files.** Whilst DF-SHOW doesn't come with a text editor like DF-EDIT (for the reason there are many good, well established text editors already available), it can launch the user's default text editor for any given selected file.
* **Copy files.** DF-SHOW can copy files to another destination.
* **Create links.** Both Symbolic and Hard links can be created using DF-SHOW.
* **Rename files.** Users' can move files to a different file name.
* **Delete files.** DF-SHOW also removes files at the user's request.
* **Create directories.** Users' are also able to create new directories from within the DF-SHOW interface.
* **Touch files.** Timestamps on files can be changed, as well as the creation of new blank files.
* **Update permissions.** Owners, groups, and permissions can be set within the application.
* **Hunt within files.** Find files in a directory containing a string.
* **Execute applications.** Files with execution permissions can be launched from withing DF-SHOW.
