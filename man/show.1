.TH "SHOW" "1" "May 23, 2023" "0.10" "Directory File Show (DF-SHOW)"
.SH NAME
show \- An interactive directory/file browser written for Unix-like systems.
.SH OVERVIEW
.sp
The \fBshow\fP application lets users view the names of files and directories on a disk with information about the files. Files can be copied, moved, viewed, and edited (in your system\(aqs default editor). The application is run using the show command. The output is similar to the \fBls\fP command.
.sp
The screen is devided into three parts. The first is the command bar which displays the functions available, their hotkeys, and aditional prompts when requested. The commands are described in more detail in the \fI\%commands\fP and \fI\%global commands\fP sections.
.sp
The second part is the middle of the screen between the top and bottom rows. This displays information for the files and directories and is known as the display window. The top three rows of the display window are header lines which identify the information being displayed in each column, the number of objects in the current directory, the total space used by the files in the current directory, the remaining disk space on the mounted partition the directory resides, and the current path. Each line gives the object\(aqs permissions, hard links, the owner and group information, size of the object, date and time of the last modification, as well as the name of each file or directory.
.sp
The third part is known as the function bar, each function can be accessed by its numeric function key. The functions are described in more deatail in the \fI\%functions\fP section.

.TP
.B \fBCopy\fP
Copy the selected file, or marked files to another file location.
When using this command, only the destination must be specified.
The destination file name is requested by one of the following
prompts. An empty response to the prompt or the \fIESC\fP key is used
to abort the command. If there are no marked files, a single file
copy is requested; otherwise, a multiple file copy is requested.
.sp
\fBCopy file to:\fP
.sp
\fBCopy multiple files to:\fP
