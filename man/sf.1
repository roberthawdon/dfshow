.SH NAME
sf \- An interactive file viewer written for Unix-like systems.
.SH OVERVIEW
.sp
The \fBsf\fP (or Show File) application displays a text file through a
logical window which can be moved forward and backward on the file.
The utility is invoked by using the \fBsf\fP command or through the
\fBshow\fP application.

the screen, a display window consisting of the middle rows of the
screen, and a file identification line at the bottom of the window.
The identification line gives the line and column number of the top
left character in the window. An example of the command line and
information line is given below.
